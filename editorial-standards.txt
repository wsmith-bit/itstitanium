Editorial Standards â€” itstitaniun.com
- Verify specs with primary sources (manufacturer pages, manuals). Avoid unverified prices; use ranges if uncertain.
- Cite sources in the copy when claims might affect safety, warranty, or performance.
- Avoid hype language; prefer measurable, testable statements.
- Update cadence: re-check key pages quarterly or when major models revise.
- Accessibility: headings in order, alt text for all images, captioned figures and data tables.
- Affiliate independence: recommendations are not for sale. Disclose clearly above the fold.
