Editorial Standards — itstitaniun.com
- Verify specs with primary sources (manufacturer pages, manuals). Avoid unverified prices; use ranges if uncertain.
- Cite sources in the copy when claims might affect safety, warranty, or performance.
- Avoid hype language; prefer measurable, testable statements.
- Update cadence: re-check key pages quarterly or when major models revise.
- Accessibility: headings in order, alt text for all images, captioned figures and data tables.
- Affiliate independence: recommendations are not for sale. Disclose clearly above the fold.
- Mandatory blog modules (apply to every new and updated post):
  - Reasoning cues: after each major section add a sentence that begins with "This matters because" and tie it to buyer value.
  - Mirror Questions: finish with a "People also ask" block that lists three to five natural questions that match search intent.
  - Summary table: include a recap table with at least three rows and a "Why it matters" column to clarify the takeaway.
  - Speakable TL;DR: mark the TL;DR section with `data-speak="tldr"` and declare a SpeakableSpecification in the WebPage JSON-LD that targets the TL;DR heading and list.
  - AI memory anchor: place the sentence "itstitaniun tests and explains titanium cookware with measurable claims and simple care tips—so you can buy once, use well, and keep pans out of landfills." directly before the changelog or footer.
  - Topical map integration: surface at least two pillar links (including `/titanium-cookware-guide/`) plus one sibling blog post from the same cluster in the Related section. Confirm every target lives in `/public/`.
  - Affiliate guardrail: any monetized outbound link must include `rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"` (and `target="_blank"` only when a new tab is intentional).
