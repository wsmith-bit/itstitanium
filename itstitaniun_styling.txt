MISSION
- Visual + UX spec for itstitaniun.com (titanium cookware affiliate).
- Every page must render as production-grade HTML5 with a clean, buyer-focused cooking aesthetic.
- No placeholders. No partials. All outputs must follow these tokens, layout rules, and components.

CORE VOICE
- Warm, practical “kitchen pro” tone. Clear, measured claims; buyer-first guidance.
- Avoid AI tells (no emdash, no vague hype, no filler). Cite facts or omit.

AUDIENCE
- Home cooks, health-forward buyers, gear comparers (nonstick vs titanium vs ceramic), and value hunters.

  -- Steel      #637083 (muted/ui text)

GLOBAL LAYOUT
- Header: compact nav, logo left, in-header search field right; becomes sticky after first scroll.
- Hero: single headline, 1–2 line deck, one primary CTA; light illustration or product laydown.
- Breadcrumbs: show above H1 on internal pages.
- Footer: brief about, nav, disclosure link, sitemap link.

VISIBILITY & CHECKLIST-FIRST ELEMENTS (REQUIRED)
- Above-the-fold FTC disclosure element (see component below).
- “Last updated” stamp near top with ISO datetime `datetime=""` attribute.
- Table of Contents (TOC) auto-generated from H2–H3; collapsible on mobile.
- Reading progress bar (thin fixed bar at top of viewport).
- TL;DR box with 2–4 bullets and one decisive pick.
- Snippet-friendly Q&A blocks for zero-click AI answers (concise 2–3 sentences).
- Internal links to pillars + related posts in “Related” card grid.
- Version note or “What changed” details near footer when materially updated.

IMAGERY & MEDIA
- All <img>: explicit width/height, `decoding="async"`, `loading="lazy"` (hero excluded), descriptive alt.
- Formats: WebP/AVIF preferred, JPG fallback as needed.
- Use <figure> + <figcaption> for product visuals and comparison shots.
- Optional: audio TL;DR using `<audio controls>` with transcript in <details>.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Logical H1→H2→H3; skip no levels. Visible focus states on interactive elements.
- Color contrast: minimum AA (4.5:1 text), buttons >= 3:1 against background.
- Sticky table headers and captions for data tables. Use `<th scope="col|row">`.
- IDs on headings for anchor links and AI memory anchors.
- Avoid purely color-based meaning; use icons/labels for callouts and pros/cons.

AFFILIATE COMPLIANCE
- Disclosure visible within first screen: “We test and recommend cookware. If you buy via links on this page, we may earn a commission at no cost to you.”
- All affiliate links: `rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"`; if new tab, `target="_blank"`.
- Human, descriptive anchor text; never “click here”.

REQUIRED SEO/AI ELEMENTS (VISIBLE CUES)
- Canonical URL, robots meta, full OG/Twitter set in <head>.
- JSON-LD single `@graph`: Organization, WebSite (+SearchAction), WebPage, BreadcrumbList + page-type (BlogPosting/Article, HowTo for care, FAQPage for ≥3 Q/A, Product/Review if verifiable).
- Clear intent marker in intro (who this is for; buying use case).
- “As covered in…” cross-references when relevant (internal memory anchors).
- Facts and ranges must be verifiable; omit prices unless sourced.

COMPONENT LIBRARY (CLASS NAMES & BEHAVIORS)
- Container
  * `.wrap` — centers content, sets max-width and gutters.

  * `.btn .btn-primary` — Sear bg, Plate text, rounded-2xl, .shadow-sm; hover darken Sear.
  * `.btn .btn-secondary` — Leaf border/text on Plate bg.
- Cards
  * `.card` — Plate/Foam bg, rounded-2xl, .shadow-md, 16–20px padding.
  * `.card-grid` — use .grid-2 / .grid-3 to lay out product/guide cards.
- TOC
  * `.toc` — small card with section list; sticky on desktop sidebar; collapsible on mobile with `<details>`.
- Progress
  * `.reading-progress` — fixed 3–4px bar at top; width reflects scroll progress.
- Callouts
  * `.note.note-info` (Leaf border), `.note.note-warning` (Sear border), `.note.note-safe` (Leaf bg pale).
- Comparison Table
  * `.table.compare` — zebra rows, sticky header, caption above; fields: Model, Pan Size/Diameter, Weight, Coating Type, Oven-Safe Temp, Induction, Warranty, Care Level, Price Band.
- Product Card (for roundups)
  * `.product-card` — image top (16:9), brand/model, three key specs, pros/cons mini-list, CTA.
  * Optional rating stars (visual only; don’t fabricate aggregate ratings).
- FAQ
  * `.faq` — list of `<details><summary>Q</summary><div>A</div></details>`; 5–10 targeted Qs.
- Disclosure
  * `.disclosure` — subtle Foam bg, small Leaf icon, link to disclosure policy.
- Related
  * `.related-grid` — 1–3 cards linking to pillars or sibling posts.
- Badges/Chips
  * `.chip` — small rounded label for attributes like “Induction-ready”, “Oven-safe 500°F”.
- Breadcrumbs
  * `.breadcrumbs` — small Steel text; “Home / Category / Page”.

PAGE PATTERNS
- Homepage
  * Hero with one CTA (“See Best Titanium Pans 2025”).
  * 3-up card row: “Top Picks”, “Titanium vs Ceramic”, “Care & Cleaning”.
  * “Editor’s Choice” product card.
  * Latest posts grid (3–6 cards).
- Pillar (Guide/Hub)
  * TL;DR box; TOC; sections for Buying Factors, Materials, Coating, Safety, Use Cases, Care & Cleaning; comparison table; FAQs; related links.
- Blog Post (Targeted)
  * Quick Answer snippet; 2–3 intent-led sections; a focused comparison table or checklist; FAQs; next-step CTA.

PERFORMANCE
- Preload hero image; defer non-critical scripts; inline small critical CSS.
- Avoid layout shift: always include width/height, font-display swap for webfonts if used.

STRUCTURED CONTENT HOOKS (VISIBLE)
- “Last updated” stamp near the top with `<time datetime="">Updated Month Day, Year</time>`.
- “What changed” `<details>` near footer when updated.
- Captions for all figures and data tables.
- Optional `speakable` selection: TL;DR headline + 2 short sentences.

FILE/ASSET CONVENTIONS
- CSS: /styles/main.css (small critical CSS may be inlined).
- Images: /assets/img/  (name as `{slug}-{angle|context}-{width}.webp`).
- Slugs: kebab-case; blog posts often end with year, e.g., `/blog/best-titanium-frying-pan-for-induction-2025.html`.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do not invent specs, warranties, or prices.
- Do not hide disclosures.
- Do not rely on color alone to communicate meaning.

APPENDIX: CHECKLIST ALIGNMENT (VISIBLE UX MAPPING)
- TOC + progress bar → zero-click/readability signals.
- TL;DR + QA blocks → snippet boxes and conversational answers.
- Sticky table headers + captions → rich snippet and assistive parsing.
- “Last updated” + change log → freshness hooks.
- Intent markers + use-case callouts → AI intent matching.
- IDs on headings + cross-links → topical map & memory anchors.
